The payment flow is still broken and confusing. After purchase, it **just ends** — there is no clear way back to the app, and users think they need to sign up again. This must be fixed clearly and explicitly.

Here is what is missing and must be added:

1. **Stripe success return is not visible to the user**
   - After payment, the user must land on a page that clearly says:
     **“Payment successful — you now have access.”**
   - This page must include:
     - A **big primary button**: “Go to Dashboard”
     - A fallback link: “Return to app”
   - Do NOT rely on auto-redirect alone — users need something to click.

2. **Account ↔ payment is not clearly linked**
   - Users should NOT feel like they need to sign up again after paying.
   - If the user is already authenticated when clicking “Pay”:
     - Their user ID/email must be attached to the Stripe checkout (metadata or client reference ID).
   - If they are NOT authenticated:
     - After payment, clearly prompt:
       **“Create or sign in to the account you want this purchase applied to.”**
     - Then permanently attach the payment to that account.

3. **Stop the “sign up again” confusion**
   - If a paid user signs in:
     - They should NEVER see pricing or sign-up walls again.
     - They should go directly to the dashboard.
   - Add explicit logic:
     - Paid → dashboard
     - Unpaid → billing
     - No ambiguous middle states.

4. **Make the flow human-clear**
   Walk through this exact path and fix every gap:
   - Visit site
   - Sign up or sign in
   - Click pricing
   - Pay
   - See confirmation with a button
   - Click back into the app
   - Refresh page
   - Log out and back in

   At no point should the user wonder:
   - “Did it work?”
   - “Do I need to sign up again?”
   - “Where do I go now?”

5. **Do not assume users understand Stripe**
   - The app must explain what just happened and what to do next.
   - Explicit copy > implicit redirects.

This is not a small tweak — it’s a UX + logic fix.  
Please fix the **entire experience so it feels obvious, safe, and finished**.
